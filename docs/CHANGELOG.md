# Changelog

All notable changes to Archon are documented here.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04

It replaces the earlier shell-script checkout workflow with an installable `archon` CLI, adds an
auto-launching dashboard and graph visualization, and makes re-initializing an already-initialized project safe and interactive.

Upgrading an existing project? See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

### Added

- **`archon` CLI** with commands `init`, `loop`, `dashboard`, `doctor`,
  `prove`, `setup`, and `update`. Replaces `archon-loop.sh`, `init.sh`,
  `review.sh`, and related shell scripts.
- **One-line installer** at
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frenzymath/Archon/refs/heads/main/install.sh`,
  runnable with `curl ... | bash`.
- **`archon update`** command to update the installed CLI without cloning
  the repository manually.
- **Interactive re-init flow**: when a project is already initialized,
  `archon init` offers `keep` / `merge` / `overwrite` / `abort`. The
  `merge` mode launches Claude Code to reconcile prompts and `CLAUDE.md`
  file-by-file.
- **Legacy-layout detection**: older projects that used symlinked prompts
  are detected and migrated gracefully instead of erroring.
- **Auto-launching web dashboard**: `archon loop` starts the dashboard in
  the background on a free port in 8080–8099 and prints the URL. Disable
  with `--no-dashboard`; open a browser automatically with `--open`. The
  dashboard persists after the loop finishes so results can be reviewed.
- **Graph view** in the dashboard UI: interactive proof dependency graph.

### Known limitations

- The bundled informal agent remains a single-call demonstration. Our
  internal richer implementation is not yet ready for open-source release.
- Single-problem benchmarks (e.g. competition problems) are not a target;
  Archon is optimized for multi-file, project-level formalization.
