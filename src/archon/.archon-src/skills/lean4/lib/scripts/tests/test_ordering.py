"""Deterministic test for benefit-based sort order in find_golfable.py.

Validates that analyze_file() returns patterns sorted by policy order:
  directness → performance → structural → conditional
and that intra-phase ordering matches the documented phase position
(by-exact before apply-exact-chain within directness).

Also validates cross-file ordering via analyze_files(): directness hits
from a later file appear before conditional hits from an earlier file.

Run:
    python3 tests/test_ordering.py
    # or from repo root:
    python3 plugins/lean4/lib/scripts/tests/test_ordering.py
